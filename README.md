## Project Summary

**NextRead.ai** is a user-centric book recommendation system developed using machine learning. It applies **collaborative filtering** with **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **cosine similarity** to generate tailored book suggestions based on user preferences.

This project addresses a real-world needâ€”helping readers explore meaningful titles from large datasets. A clean, interactive UI is built using **Streamlit**, offering a seamless user experience. The model is trained on the **Book-Crossing** dataset and is deployed on **Heroku** for accessibility.

## Key Highlights

* Collaborative Filtering with a user-item matrix and cosine distance
* Pre-trained model for efficient, low-latency predictions
* Based on the Book-Crossing dataset with 1M+ ratings
* Interactive Streamlit UI for input and output display
* Cloud deployment on Heroku for real-time access

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Implementation of unsupervised ML algorithms (KNN)
* Use of similarity metrics for recommendation logic
* Web application development with Streamlit
* Model serialization and deployment pipelines
* Git, version control, and collaborative development practices
* End-to-end machine learning system design

## Algorithm Logic

1. Build a sparse user-item matrix using book rating data.
2. Apply K-Nearest Neighbors with cosine similarity to find related books based on user behavior.
3. Identify top-K books with the highest similarity scores.
4. Display recommended books via a modern web interface.

## Dataset Used

**Book-Crossing Dataset**
Includes:

* Book metadata (`BX-Books.csv`)
* User ratings (`BX-Book-Ratings.csv`)
* User demographics (`BX-Users.csv`)

**Source**: [Kaggle - Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ra4u12/bookrecommendation)
